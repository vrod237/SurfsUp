# surfs_up
## Project Overview
Purpose is to gather data during June and December of Oahu and determine whether the seasons could affect the surf and ice cream shop business. Specifically, are there certain times of the year when the business might be slower, or the type of customer could be different?

- Determine key statistical data about the month of June.

- Determine key statistical data about the month of December.

- Compare your findings between the month of June and December.

- Make 2 or 3 recommendations for further analysis.

- Share your findings in the Jupyter Notebook.

#### Temperature Review

#### Precipitation Review

#### Recommendations
We would need more information in order to have a complete analysis of seasonal weather in Oahu. Ideally this would be information from the entire year or more months from the rainy and dry seasons, can't really provide a true analysis based off of two months.
